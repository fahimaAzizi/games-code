Project Overview: Game and Utility Collection 🕹️💻
This repository contains a collection of small games and utility programs written in C++. Each project showcases a unique set of features and demonstrates basic to intermediate C++ programming concepts. Here's a breakdown of the files and their functionality:

🟢 Chess Game
Files: chess.cpp, chess.exe
Status: Completed ✅ (2 months ago)
Description: A console-based chess game where players can compete against each other. The game includes basic chess rules such as piece movement, checks, and checkmates.

🟡 Hangman Game
Files: hangman.cpp, hangman.exe, path.txt
Status: Completed ✅ (Last month)
Description: Classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess the correct word by guessing individual letters within a set number of attempts.

path.txt contains the list of words used in the Hangman game.
🟠 Login System
Files: login.cpp, login.exe
Status: Completed ✅ (Last month)
Description: A simple console-based login system. Users can create an account, log in, and manage basic authentication processes.

🔵 Pong Game
Files: pong.cpp, pong.exe
Status: Completed ✅ (2 months ago)
Description: A simple 2D console Pong game. Players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The game supports two players for head-to-head fun.

🟣 Main Program
Files: main.cpp
Status: Completed ✅ (Last month)
Description: Likely a central launcher or menu program that ties together the other projects, providing an interface to select and run different games or utilities.

🚀 How to Use
Compile the Source Code:
Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) to compile the .cpp files if you want to explore or modify the code.

bash
Copy code
g++ chess.cpp -o chess.exe
Run Executable Files:
Directly execute the .exe files to play the games or use the utilities.

File Dependencies:
Ensure path.txt is in the same directory as hangman.exe for the word list to function properly.
